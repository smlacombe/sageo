To install WTForms, run the following command:

    python setup.py install

You can also download and install WTForms directly from the Python Package Index
using either pip or easy_install:

    pip install WTForms
    easy_install -Z WTForms

If you prefer, you can also simply place the `wtforms` subdirectory somewhere on
your python path. This is useful if you are running the latest version from
Mercurial, or want to deploy WTForms with your application on for example Google
App Engine.

Note that you need Python 2.4 or later to use WTForms.
